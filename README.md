### Cabal

*"Well, regarding the name, Cabal is indeed the library that all tools use, e.g. the .cabal file in a project. The bad name here is the build tool "cabal-install" because that has confused the hell out of everyone. There's three things here: a library called Cabal, a build tool called "Stack", and a build tool that should be called "some-haskell-build-tool" like maybe "haskbuilder" but is instead called "cabal-install" because it is some-build-tool-that-uses-the-Cabal-library (although that description works for Stack too). So the two tools with cabal in the name confuse everyone."*

http://mutanatum.com/posts/2017-01-12-Browser-FP-Head-to-Head.html

[Elm](http://elm-lang.org) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API

HaskellPlatform-7.10.3-x86_64-setup  
https://downloads.haskell.org/~platform/7.10.3/HaskellPlatform-7.10.3-x86_64-setup.exe

Once the Haskell Platform is installed, do

```
cabal install hsdev
```

And it should then copy the following executables in the `bin` folder

```
01/17/2017  12:33 PM        10,316,288 aeson-pretty.exe
01/17/2017  12:32 PM         2,250,240 cpphs.exe

01/17/2017  12:39 PM        82,321,408 hsclearimports.exe
01/17/2017  12:39 PM        82,655,744 hsdev.exe
01/17/2017  12:39 PM        82,303,488 hshayoo.exe
01/17/2017  12:39 PM        82,310,656 hsinspect.exe
```

Once hsdev is installed, do

```
cabal install stylish-haskell
```

And it should then copy the following executables in the `bin` folder

```
01/17/2017  12:46 PM        10,061,824 json2yaml.exe
01/17/2017  12:47 PM        18,455,040 stylish-haskell.exe
01/17/2017  12:46 PM         9,517,056 yaml2json.exe
```

After that, use Stack for everything else.
